    <aside>And it's only at the beginning of what I have envisioned.</aside>
    </header><h2>Here, you will be able to find all the serious and fun internet products I've worked on.</h2><p><strong>Every. Product. Ever.</strong></p><p>That's right, I will add everything I've ever worked on that isn't covered by an NDA, work contract or <a
    href="compromising_stuff.html">would put my life in danger</a>. But <em>some</em> things are more hidden than others. Here, you may (when it is fully developed) find:</p>
    <ul><li>Memes <em>with</em> context, so that <em>any</em> individual can understand them despite social class</li>
        <li>Demos of games I have made</li>
        <li>Drafts of books I started writing</li>
        <li>Photos because I <em>used</em> to take picture before my phone addiction started</li>
        <li>Quizzes because it's such a <em>huge</em> shame that no personal websites have them these days</li>
        <li>Guides: "How to be in a relationship with a programmer", "Tips for raising children in a hypertechnical world" and "How to not age like milk, politically"</li>
    </ul><h3>Who was I again?</h3>
        <p>I'm Veron!</p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I finished my master's in Software Design in 2024 from the IT University of Copenhagen, and <em>no</em> I'm not going to pursue that PdF. I'm <em>done</em> with university.</p>
                <p>Apart from that I have a bachelor's in Global Business Informatics from the same university, an STX from Gefion Gymnasium (Musik A, Engelsk A <em>4 lyfe</em>) and 10 years of folkeskole at Heibergskolen</p>
            <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>Will upload my full CV. You will be able to see things that never <em>have</em> and never <em>will</em> appear on LinkedIn. Exclusive stuff, yo.</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p><a
                    href="https://mikaelskotting.dk/">My dad</a> says I can do anything, but it's not entirely true. But I have not yet decided on whether I should display my skills as a white- or blacklist.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Extroverted, opinionated, creative, funny and confident. I am also quite productive, but I tend to hide behind aliases to keep my trail clean in case someone I pursue with professional intentions decides to <em>DuckDuckGo</em> me.</p>
        <h3>That is <em>all</em> I have done so far on this website</h3>
            <p>You can find me on <a
                href="https://helvede.net/@alphapony">Helvede.net</a> for now, as I have not decided yet what accounts I should link to my name.</p><blockquote>"Du er en laks."
